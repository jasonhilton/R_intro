Normally html pages is provided to our web-browsers in response to a request, which might occur, for instance, when we click on a link. However, we are going to request a web-page using R, and use the R package Rvest to extract data from the result.\nA very simple example of an html document is given below. We have opening and closing html tags which defining html elements, which may be nested within each other. In the below, there is a paragraph element &lt;p&gt; with some text content which is contained within a &lt;div&gt; element (div for ‘division’) which is generally used to divide up the page and group together particular elements that are related somehow.\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Meta-information, title, scripts. --&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt; I am here! &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\nA more visual example of an html page structure is given below:\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp"

    "text": "Recap: CSS selectors\nWhen we identify a page from which we want to scrape data, it is helpful to investigate the html source of this page. The will help us right the code that will allow us to select the elements from which we want to extract content.\nYou may remember from the lecture that we can do this using css selectors. CSS stands for cascading style sheet, and it is the language through which website programmers how particular groups of the html elements should appear.\nThe style of HTML content is the way it appears when it is viewed through a web browser.\nThis is generally determined by instructions written in the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) language.\n\nThese instructions provides information about fonts, colours, size etc.\n\nWhy do we care about this?\n\nIn order to determine which elements of an HTML page should be styled, CSS uses selectors\nThis is specific way of referring to particular elements, classes and ids in CSS code\nWe can use these CSS selectors to specify which html elements we want to extract for analysis\n\nThe most important css rules are:\n\nTo select by element, the name of the element is simply written. For example p, h2, div, etc\nTo select by class, we add the . symbol. For example, .big-title\nTo select by id, we add the # symbol: #bio.\n\nWe can chain these selectors together:\n\np.body-text selects all paragraph elements of class body-text\n.body-text.intro selects all elements with both classes body text and intro\n.body-text .intro note space selects all elements of class intro that are descendents of elements of class .body-text.\n\nFull reference here: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php\nNow that we have done our revision, we can try look at trying to scrape data from a particular site.\nVisit https://quotes.toscrape.com/ and examine the structure of the site. This site contains a set of quotations from various famous people. The information is spread over several pages. We would like to extract information from each of these quotes, and load them into a sensible dataframe.\nWe start by loading in the packages tidyverse and rvest.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.0     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nWarning: package 'rvest' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'rvest'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    guess_encoding\n\n\nWe can use the rvest function read_html to read the html of the quotes page mentioned previously. The function issues a http request and parses the result.\n\nquotes_html  &lt;- read_html(\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/\")\nquotes_html\n\n{html_document}\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n[1] &lt;head&gt;\\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...\n[2] &lt;body&gt;\\n    &lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\\n        &lt;div class=\"row header-box\"&gt; ...\n\n\nThe result is an R object quotes_html that contains an R representation of the website.\nWe can use the function html_elements to extract all elements that match a particular css selector. But first we need to find which css elements we want to extract.\nIn the quotes to scrape website, right click anywhere on the page and click ‘View page source’ or similar (the exact menu option may depend upon your browser). You should be able to see the html source corresponding to this page.\nTake a moment to examine the structure of the page, and see how it compares to what you see when you open the web page with the browser.\nYou may notice that each quote is contained within a div element of class quote. Within each of these divs is a span of class text, which contains the text of the quote, and a small element of class author, which has the name of the author.\nTherefore, we can extract all the div elements of class quote using the css selector div.quote.\n\nquotes_html %&gt;% html_elements(\"div.quote\")\n\n{xml_nodeset (10)}\n [1] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [2] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [3] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [4] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [5] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [6] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [7] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [8] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n [9] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n[10] &lt;div class=\"quote\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/CreativeWork\"&gt;\\ ...\n\n\nWe can extract all the elements, within the quote div, we might want to extract the text span. We can do this by using the selector div.quote .text, which selects all descendents of class .text which were descendents of div elements of class quote.\n\nquotes_html %&gt;% html_elements(\"div.quote .text\")\n\n{xml_nodeset (10)}\n [1] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“The world as we have created it is a ...\n [2] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“It is our choices, Harry, that show  ...\n [3] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“There are only two ways to live your ...\n [4] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“The person, be it gentleman or lady, ...\n [5] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“Imperfection is beauty, madness is g ...\n [6] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“Try not to become a man of success.  ...\n [7] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“It is better to be hated for what yo ...\n [8] &lt;span class=\"text\" itemprop=\"text\"&gt;“I have not failed.

Putting it all together:\n\nquote_text &lt;- quotes_html %&gt;% html_elements(\"div.quote .text\") %&gt;%\n  html_text2()\n\nlength(quote_text)\n\n[1] 10\n\nquote_text[10]\n\n[1] \"“A day without sunshine is like, you know, night.”\"\n\n\nTASK: Try to write similar code to extract the name of the author of each quote.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nauthors &lt;- quotes_html %&gt;% html_elements(\"div.quote .author\") %&gt;%\n  html_text2()\n\nauthors\n\n [1] \"Albert Einstein\"   \"J.K.

We would like to extract data from each from each of these pages.\nHowever, as we mentioned we would like to do this is a ‘polite’ manner, obeying instructions in the sites robots.txt file (which tells where we are allowed to scrape), and not making page requests too quickly.\nWe can do this using the aptly-named polite R package, which interacts well with rvest.\nThere are three functions we need to use from the polite package, bow, scrape and nod.\n\nbow specifies what rate we should scrape at and parses the robots.txt file, as well as the base url of the site.\nscrape issues the http request to actually download the page.\nnod specifies any additional page we would like to scrape.\n\nWe can use these function to extract the same information as previously.\n\nlibrary(polite)\n\nWarning: package 'polite' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\npolite_connection &lt;- bow(\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/\")\n\n\npolite_connection %&gt;% scrape() %&gt;% \n  html_elements(\"div.quote .text\") %&gt;%\n  html_text2()\n\n [1] \"“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking.

However, we now want to do the same for the sports, politics, etc. articles.\nIdeally, we don’t want to have to repeat the same code for each article. This can make code difficult to read and it is very easy to introduce errors when copying and pasting code. Instead, we shall write our own function to read in articles for any given category, and create a data.frame that holds the text of the articles and their categories.\n\nAn aside: Writing R functions\nIf you are familiar with R functions, skip this part.\nAn R function can be defined by writing function followed by the names you want to give for the arguments to your function enclosed in parenthesis (arg1, arg2), followed by the code that describes what you want your function to do between curly brackets {}. A function should describe what should be returned (outputted) once it is finished.\nAn example is given below that computes the mean of the first argument, and then adds on the second argument. We wouldn’t ever write a function like this, as it is easier just to write this directly, but the below serves as a good example of how to write a function in R.\n\n# a silly example\nmy_func_name &lt;- function(argument1, argument2){\n  # do stuff here \n  mean_of_arg_1 &lt;- mean(argument1)\n  answer &lt;- mean_of_arg_1 + argument2\n  return(answer)\n}\n\nAs with existing R functions we can call this function by typing its name and providing the specific arguments we want to run the code with:\n\n# call (that is, use) the function \nmy_func_name(c(1,2,3), 5)\n\n[1] 7\n\n# call it with different arguments\nmy_func_name(c(4,5,6), -1)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nNote that the names of arguments and any variables we create inside functions are removed after the function has finished running, so we can not now access argument1 or mean_of_arg_1 (try it and you should get a name error).\n\n\nBack to the BBC news data\nWe can write a function to read in all the files for one category\n\nread_category &lt;- function(category, bbc_path){\n  # The lines below has the same steps we went through above\n  category_path &lt;- paste0(bbc_path, \"/\", category)\n  category_files &lt;- list.files(category_path)\n  category_paths &lt;- paste0(category_path, \"/\", category_files) \n  category_articles &lt;- map_chr(category_paths, read_file)\n  \n  # code below creates a dataframe with column names \"Category\" and \"text\"\n  cat_df &lt;- tibble(Category=category, text=category_articles)\n  return(cat_df)\n}\n\nLet’s try this on a different category\n\ncategories[3]\n\n[1] \"politics\"\n\npol_df &lt;- read_category(categories[3], base_path)\npol_df\n\n# A tibble: 417 × 2\n   Category text                                                                \n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;                                                               \n 1 politics \"Labour plans maternity pay rise\\n\\nMaternity pay for new mothers i…\n 2 politics \"Watchdog probes e-mail deletions\\n\\nThe information commissioner s…\n 3 politics \"Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity l…\n 4 politics \"Labour chooses Manchester\\n\\nThe Labour Party will hold its 2006 a…\n 5 politics \"Brown ally rejects Budget spree\\n\\nChancellor Gordon Brown's close…\n 6 politics \"'Errors' doomed first Dome sale\\n\\nThe initial attempt to sell the…\n 7 politics \"Fox attacks Blair's Tory 'lies'\\n\\nTony Blair lied when he took th…\n 8 politics \"Women MPs reveal sexist taunts\\n\\nWomen MPs endure \\\"shocking\\\" le…\n 9 politics \"Campbell: E-mail row 'silly fuss'\\n\\nEx-No 10 media chief Alastair…\n10 politics \"Crucial decision on super-casinos\\n\\nA decision on whether to allo…\n# ℹ 407 more rows\n\n\nWe want all 5 categories in one dataframe to allow us to begin modelling.\nRather than constructing all 5 dataframes in separate bits of code, we can use map_df function to apply read_categories to all the elements of categories.\nThe below code may take a little time to run (but hopefully not too long). Reading lots of small files from disk is generally less efficient than reading one medium size file.\nNote that we also add a doc_id column, which gives each article a unique identification number, using the n() function to identify the maximum number of rows, and creating a sequence from 1 to this number (2225 in this case).\n\n# note that any additional arguments to read_category that do not change with each\n# iteration (in this case, base_path) can be given to map after the name of the function\ndata_df &lt;- map_df(categories, read_category, base_path) %&gt;% \n  # add unique id\n  mutate(doc_id=1:n()) %&gt;% \n  # reorder columns for convenience\n  select(doc_id, Category, text)\ndata_df\n\n# A tibble: 2,225 × 3\n   doc_id Category text                                                         \n    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;                                                        \n 1      1 business \"Ad sales boost Time Warner profit\\n\\nQuarterly profits at U…\n 2      2 business \"Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\\n\\nThe dollar has hit its …\n 3      3 business \"Yukos unit buyer faces loan claim\\n\\nThe owners of embattle…\n 4      4 business \"High fuel prices hit BA's profits\\n\\nBritish Airways has bl…\n 5      5 business \"Pernod takeover talk lifts Domecq\\n\\nShares in UK drinks an…\n 6      6 business \"Japan narrowly escapes recession\\n\\nJapan's economy teetere…\n 7      7 business \"Jobs growth still slow in the US\\n\\nThe US created fewer jo…\n 8      8 business \"India calls for fair trade rules\\n\\nIndia, which attends th…\n 9      9 business \"Ethiopia's crop production up 24%\\n\\nEthiopia produced 14.2…\n10     10 business \"Court rejects $280bn tobacco case\\n\\nA US government claim …\n# ℹ 2,215 more rows"

    "section": "Data Structures",
    "text": "Data Structures\nThe basic data types can be combined within data structures. R has several of these.\n\nVectors\nVectors are the simplest of the data types. We can create vectors using the c() function, with elements of the vector separated by commas:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nYou can even make vectors using strings instead of numerical values\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou cannot mix data types within a vector, however:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also create vectors consisting of a range of integers by writing the start and end of the range you want, separated by a colon:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSometimes, we want to select particular elements from within a vector. To do this, we write the name of the vector, followed by square brackets, and the position of the thing we want within the vector.\nFor instance, if we want the second element from the list of cat names, we write:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can select more than one element using ‘slicing’. We use the same range method as before:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can find the length of a vector using the length function.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n}}\n\n\nAn aside: The help function\nTo find our more information about a particular function, we can use the help function. For instance, to find out more about the mean function, we can call the help function with mean as the argument:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is usually instantaneous, but takes a few seconds in the web version of R.\nTry to calculate the mean of the first 5 numbers of the my_numbers vector we created above.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nNA values\nYou may have noticed in the help file for the mean function, there is an argument to the function called na.rm. This stands for ‘NA remove’. NA stands for ‘Not Available’, and is used by R to represent missing values. If we try to calculate the mean of a vector containing missing values, we will obtain a missing value. This is to ensure that we always no when we might have a problem with our calculations due to missing or invalid data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat do you think seq is doing in the code above? Try using the seq function in the space below, and use the help function to find out how it works. Some of the help file may be confusing, but focus on the bits under the argument heading Arguments and Value.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nCalculate the mean of my_data without the NA value. Do this using the mean function, and via indexing.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nLists\nLists are very similar to vectors, but can include data of different types. This means calculations with them are a bit slower, but they are more flexible.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can extract specific elements from a list using the $ symbol:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can also index elements, but to extract them we should use the double square brackets:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nData frames\nThese are probably the data structure in R you will use most often. They are used for holding whole datasets. Practically speaking, they are lists of vectors of equal length.\nThe built-in dataset iris is a good example of a dataframe. We can look at the first few rows of this dataframe using the head function:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs with lists, we can access particular columns using the $ symbol.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs with vectors, we can slice away particular parts of the dataframe. In this case we select the 10th to the 20th row, and the second and third column.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can also do this by name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCheck you understand what the above code is doing, using the help function if necessary.\n\n\nMatrix\nA matrix is another collection of vectors, but is somewhat simpler than a dataframe. All elements of a matrix must have the same type, and column names are not required. We create a matrix using the matrix function ( surprise surprise), often from vectors.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."

Try faceting the plot on the year variable.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nggplot(data=country_df, \n       mapping=aes(x=log(gdp_per_cap), y=life_expectancy,\n                   colour=continent)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  facet_wrap(~year)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4.\nPlot histograms of the continuous variables. Experiment with examining the distributions of these variables separately by year.\nNote that ggplot2 has a geom_histogram geometry that allows histograms to be created easily, mapping the continuous variable of interest to the x aesthetic. Technically speaking, this is actually a combination of a transformation of the variable into binned counts, and the use of a bar geometry, but the histogram geometry is a useful shorthand for this.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nggplot(country_df, aes(x=life_expectancy)) + \n  geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~year)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(country_df, aes(x=gdp_per_cap)) + \n  geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~year) + \n  scale_x_log10()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra\n\nWe might also want to build a stacked histogram:\n\nggplot(country_df, aes(x=life_expectancy, \n                       group=continent, fill=continent)) + \n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the difference between fill and colour in the above!\nPosition This works by using the position argument to the geometry, which we haven’t yet discussed. - The point of this attribute to geom is to avoid overplotting - Most of the time position will be set to identity - Looking at the position argument to geom_histogram (try ?geom_histogram), we notice that we it is set to stack by default. - This means bars in different groups with the same x value are translated to lie on top of one another.\nWe can overide this, adding some transparency:\n\nggplot(country_df, aes(x=life_expectancy, \n                       group=continent, fill=continent)) + \n  geom_histogram(position=\"identity\", alpha=0.5) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not a very easy plot to interpret, however, and I wouldn’t recommend it!\n\nggplot(country_df %&gt;% filter(year %in% seq(1957,2007, 10)), \n       aes(x=life_expectancy, group=continent, fill=continent)) + \n  geom_histogram() + facet_wrap(~year)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can compare more directly between continents using facet_grid, allowings us to split out facets by two cateogries, one in rows, and one in columns. But the individual plots are now quite small.\n\nggplot(country_df %&gt;% filter(year %in% seq(1967,2007, 20)), \n       aes(x=life_expectancy, group=continent, fill=continent)) + \n  geom_histogram() + facet_grid(continent~year)\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\nLabel your plots with titles and more appropriate axis names. Try a different theme, and adjust the base theme\n\n\nSolution\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(country_df %&gt;% filter(year %in% seq(1967,2008, 20)), \n       aes(x=gdp_per_cap, y=life_expectancy, colour=continent)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  scale_x_log10(labels= function(x) round(x/1000)) +\n  facet_wrap(~year) +\n  theme_bw(base_size = 20) +\n  labs(title=\"GDP per Capita vs Life Expectancy by Year\",\n       x=\"GDP per Capita (000s)\")\n\nprint(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\nSave one of your plots out to a png using ggsave.\nUse the help function to get familiar with how to use ggsave. The examples section of the bottom of the help page can be particularly useful.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n  ggsave(\"pop.png\", p)\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image"
